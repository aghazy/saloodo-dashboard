# Saloodo Tech Assignment Submission - Frontend

This repository represents the frontend portion of the Saloodo tech assignment submission. The project serves as a simulated small parcel delivery web interface, facilitating the creation of parcels by senders and enabling bikers to log in, view available parcels, pick them up, and mark them as delivered.

This repository is part of a larger solution, with the backend serving as its complementary counterpart. The combined efforts of both projects fulfill the requirements outlined in the assignment.
